# Future Epics (Phase 2+)

Features explicitly out of MVP scope.

## Scope

These epics are **NOT in MVP** — planned for Phase 2 or later.

> 🚫 Do not implement until MVP is validated.

## Planned Epics

| Epic | Name | Phase | Reason for Delay |
|------|------|-------|------------------|
| [EP-023](./EP-023-character-identity.md) | Full Character Identity | P2 | MVP has minimal identity first |
| EP-024 | Video Generation | P2 | Complexity, validate images first |
| EP-025 | Lip-sync / Talking Head | P2 | Depends on video |
| EP-026 | Voice Cloning | P2 | Complexity |
| EP-027 | Platform Auto-Posting | P2 | Integration complexity |
| EP-028 | Content Scheduling | P2 | Needs platform integration |
| EP-029 | Multi-Character Scenes | P2 | Complexity |
| EP-030 | Character Chat | P3 | Different product territory |
| EP-031 | API Access | P3 | B2B, not MVP focus |
| EP-032 | Team/Agency Features | P3 | B2B |
| EP-033 | Advanced NSFW Controls | P2 | Start with simple toggle |
| EP-034 | Referral System | P2 | Optimize CAC later |
| EP-035 | Mobile App | P3 | Web-first |
| EP-036 | i18n (Multi-language) | P2 | English only for MVP |
| EP-037 | Platform-Specific Export | P2 | OF/Fanvue/Instagram presets |

> **Note**: EP-009 to EP-013 are now used for MVP epics (Credits, Subscription, Legal, Onboarding, Education)

## Phase 2 Priorities

Based on MVP learnings, prioritize:

1. **Video generation** — if images validate demand
2. **Platform-specific export** — OF/Fanvue/Instagram presets
3. **Advanced NSFW controls** — beyond simple toggle
4. **Referral system** — once conversion is optimized

## Entry Criteria

Before starting Phase 2:

- [ ] MVP launched and stable
- [ ] D7 retention >15%
- [ ] Generation success >95%
- [ ] Payment conversion analyzed (bug fixed)
- [ ] User feedback collected
