# RYLA - Product Hypothesis

## Product Vision

**RYLA** = AI Influencer Creation & Monetization Platform

> **Category**: First integrated "AI Influencer in a Box" with monetization tools
> **Market Size**: $97B+ adult content market + $21B influencer market

---

## The Problem

**Target Users**: Content creators, marketers, and entrepreneurs who want to create and monetize AI influencers (for OnlyFans, Fanvue, TikTok, Instagram, etc.)

**Problem Statement**:
Creating and managing AI influencers is fragmented, frustrating, and inconsistent. Users bounce between 5+ separate tools (image gen, voice, video, lip-sync, scheduling) with no unified workflow, leading to:

- Inconsistent character appearance across generations
- Hours wasted on manual file juggling
- No persistent character memory or backstory
- Low-quality outputs that look fake
- **No direct path to monetization platforms** ← Key gap in market

**Evidence**:

- Ghost test funnel: **~54% payment intent conversion** (generation → payment)
- **128 WAUs** in first 2 weeks of testing
- **77 unique users** in week 1, **51** in week 2
- Primary traffic: Facebook (73 users), Direct (43), Instagram (6)
- Course seller research identified 10 core pain points
- **AI Influencer Vault** course on Skool validates paid demand for this category

## Market Opportunity

### Why Now

| Signal                   | Evidence                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Funding Activity**     | Higgsfield raised $50M (Sep 2025) for AI video/image platform      |
| **Market Fragmentation** | 40+ competitors, no dominant "AI influencer + monetization" player |
| **Revenue Potential**    | Adult creators earn **3-5x more** than mainstream influencers      |
| **Pricing Validation**   | Competitors charge €14-€124/month; market accepts premium pricing  |
| **Platform Shifts**      | Fanvue AI-friendly as OnlyFans tightens AI policies                |

### Total Addressable Market

| Segment                | Size           | RYLA Opportunity                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Adult Content Creators | $97B+ annually | Primary target - underserved by mainstream AI tools |
| Influencer Marketing   | $21B globally  | Secondary - brand partnerships                      |
| AI Companion Apps      | $2B+ projected | Adjacent - character/persona tech                   |

## Core Hypothesis

> **We believe** content creators who want AI influencers **have** fragmented tooling, inconsistent outputs, and no monetization pathway.
>
> **If we build** a unified platform that generates consistent AI personas, maintains character memory, and provides **one-click export to monetization platforms**,
>
> **They will** complete the funnel and pay for subscriptions.
>
> **We'll know we're right when** funnel-to-payment conversion exceeds **20%** and D7 retention reaches **15%**.

## Unique Value Proposition

### The Gap We Fill

| What Exists                               | What's Missing              | RYLA Solution                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **AI Image Gen** (Midjourney, SoulGen)    | No character persistence    | Consistent characters across all content |
| **AI Companions** (Replika, Character.AI) | No monetization path        | Built-in export to OF/Fanvue             |
| **OF Agencies**                           | Manual, expensive ($5K+/mo) | Automated, self-serve ($29/mo)           |
| **Viral Tools** (Higgsfield, Foxy.ai)     | No NSFW, no monetization    | Full content spectrum + revenue tools    |
| **Chat Bots** (dFans.ai)                  | No character creation       | Character + chat + content               |

### Why RYLA Wins

1. **First "AI Influencer + Monetization" Platform** - No competitor owns this category
2. **Creator-Centric** - Designed for individuals, not enterprises
3. **NSFW Support** - While Foxy.ai, SynthLife prohibit adult content
4. **Character Consistency** - The #1 pain point competitors fail to solve
5. **Transparent Pricing** - Clear tiers vs. "contact sales" competitors
