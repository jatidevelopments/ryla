# RYLA - Product Hypothesis

## Product Vision

**RYLA** = AI Influencer Creation & Management Platform for NSFW Content Creators

---

## The Problem

**Target Users**: OnlyFans creators and adult content entrepreneurs who want to create AI influencers without showing their face

**Problem Statement**:
Creating AI influencers for adult content is fragmented and frustrating. Creators bounce between 5+ tools, face inconsistent outputs, and have no clear path from idea to monetizable content. Current funnels are too long (36 steps) and payment comes too late.

**Evidence (Ghost Test Nov 2025)**:
- **39%** chose "AI OnlyFans" as primary use case
- **72%** enabled NSFW content
- **93%** are first-time AI creators
- **81%** drop-off at payment (too late in funnel)
- **44%** drop-off at partnership proof step
- **100%** completion rate once character generation starts

## Core Hypothesis

> **We believe** OnlyFans creators who want AI influencers **have** fragmented tooling, too many steps, and payment friction.
>
> **If we build** a 5-step fast track with preset templates, early email capture, and freemium pricing,
>
> **They will** complete the funnel and convert to paid subscribers.
>
> **We'll know we're right when**:
> - Email capture at step 3: **>80%**
> - Fast track usage: **>50%** of OnlyFans users
> - Payment conversion: **>40%** (up from 19%)
> - Free→paid: **>15%** within 7 days
