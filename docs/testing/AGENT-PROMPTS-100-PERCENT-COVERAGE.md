# Agent Prompts for 100% Test Coverage

**Initiative**: IN-026 - Comprehensive Testing Implementation  
**Epic**: EP-062 - Unit Test Infrastructure & Coverage  
**Goal**: Achieve **100% test coverage** for each app

## Prompt Template

Use these prompts to start separate agents for each app. Each agent should work independently to achieve 100% coverage for their assigned app.

## 🎯 Apps/Web - Unit Test Coverage Agent

```
You are implementing 100% unit test coverage for apps/web as part of EP-062 (IN-026).

CONTEXT:
- Initiative: IN-026 (Comprehensive Testing Implementation)
- Epic: EP-062 (Unit Test Infrastructure & Coverage)
- Goal: 100% test coverage for apps/web
- Test infrastructure already exists: apps/web/lib/test/, apps/web/src/test/setup.tsx
- Coverage config: apps/web/vitest.config.ts (currently 80% threshold, update to 100%)

TASK:
Achieve 100% test coverage for apps/web by creating .spec.ts/.spec.tsx files for:

1. ALL components in apps/web/components/ (every .tsx file needs .spec.tsx)
2. ALL utilities in apps/web/lib/utils/ (every .ts file needs .spec.ts)
3. ALL hooks in apps/web/lib/hooks/ or apps/web/hooks/ (every .ts file needs .spec.ts)
4. ALL services in apps/web/lib/services/ (if any, every .ts file needs .spec.ts)
5. ALL API clients in apps/web/lib/api/ (every .ts file needs .spec.ts)

REQUIREMENTS:
- Follow .cursor/rules/testing-standards.mdc
- Use MSW for network mocking (never mock useQuery/useMutation directly)
- Colocate tests with source files (Component.tsx → Component.spec.tsx)
- Use .spec.ts/.spec.tsx extensions (NOT .test.ts)
- Test user interactions, state changes, error states
- Update vitest.config.ts thresholds to 100% (lines, functions, branches, statements)

VERIFICATION:
1. Run: pnpm nx test web
2. Check coverage report: coverage/apps/web/index.html

4. All tests must pass

DELIVERABLES:
- All missing .spec.ts/.spec.tsx files created

## 📋 Quick Reference

### Commands
```bash
# Run tests for specific app/lib
pnpm nx test web
pnpm nx test api
pnpm nx test funnel
pnpm nx test landing
pnpm nx test admin
pnpm nx test business
pnpm nx test ui
pnpm nx test shared
pnpm nx test trpc

# View coverage
open coverage/apps/web/index.html
open coverage/apps/api/index.html
# etc.
```

### Coverage Thresholds Update
Update `vitest.config.ts` for each app/lib:
```typescript
thresholds: {
    lines: 100,      // Changed from 80
    functions: 100,  // Changed from 80
    branches: 100,   // Changed from 80
    statements: 100, // Changed from 80
}
```

### Test File Naming
- ✅ `Component.spec.tsx` (correct)
- ❌ `Component.test.tsx` (wrong)
- ✅ `Service.spec.ts` (correct)
- ❌ `Service.test.ts` (wrong)

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Each agent should achieve:
- ✅ 100% test coverage for their assigned app/lib
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Coverage thresholds set to 100%
- ✅ Tests follow testing standards
- ✅ Tests are maintainable and fast
