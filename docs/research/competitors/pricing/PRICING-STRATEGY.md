## Recommended Pricing Strategy

### Goal: Be 2-3x Better Value Than Competitors (Not 15-30x)

**Strategy Principles:**
1. **Entry tier**: Match or beat budget leaders ($9-14/mo range)
2. **Pro tier**: Maintain competitive position ($49/mo is good)
3. **Unlimited tier**: Keep at $99/mo (already competitive)
4. **Annual discount**: Increase to 40-50% (match market standard)
5. **Per-image costs**: **ADJUST** to be 2-3x better (not 15-30x better)
6. **Credit costs**: Increase feature costs to align with market positioning

---

## Option A: Add Basic Tier + Adjust Credit Costs (Recommended)

**Add a new "Basic" tier below Starter AND increase credit costs to be 2-3x better (not 15-30x).**

### Adjusted Credit Costs (2-3x Increase)

**Current → Proposed:**

| Feature | Current Credits | Proposed Credits | Current Cost | Proposed Cost | Rationale |
|---------|----------------|------------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Studio Fast** | 5 credits | **15 credits** | $0.005 | $0.015 | 3x increase - still 2x better than competitors |
| **Studio Standard** | 15 credits | **40 credits** | $0.015 | $0.040 | 2.7x increase - competitive with market |
| **Character Creation** | 30 credits | **80 credits** | $0.030 | $0.080 | 2.7x increase - 3 images for $0.08 |
| **Profile Set Fast** | 50 credits | **120 credits** | $0.050 | $0.120 | 2.4x increase - 8 images for $0.12 |
| **Profile Set Quality** | 100 credits | **250 credits** | $0.100 | $0.250 | 2.5x increase - premium quality |

### New Pricing Structure

| Plan | Monthly | Annual | Monthly Credits | Cost/Credit | Target Competitor |
|------|---------|--------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Free** | $0 | $0 | 500 (one-time) | N/A | Trial |
| **Basic** | **$14/mo** | **$99/year** ($8.25/mo) | 15,000 | $0.00093 | Beat Influencer Studio ($10) |
| **Starter** | $29/mo | $179/year ($14.92/mo) | 30,000 | $0.00097 | Beat CreatorCore ($29.95) |
| **Pro** | $49/mo | $329/year ($27.42/mo) | 60,000 | $0.00082 | Beat Higgsfield ($49.8) |
| **Unlimited** | $99/mo | $659/year ($54.92/mo) | ∞ | N/A | Beat average ($119.25) |

**Annual Discounts:**
- Basic: 41% off ($14 → $8.25/mo)
- Starter: 49% off ($29 → $14.92/mo) - improved from 31%
- Pro: 44% off ($49 → $27.42/mo) - improved from 31%
- Unlimited: 45% off ($99 → $54.92/mo) - improved from 31%

**Competitive Positioning (After Credit Cost Adjustment):**
- ✅ Basic ($14/mo): 1,000 fast images OR 375 standard images (2-3x better than competitors' 100-200 images)
- ✅ Starter ($29/mo): 2,000 fast images OR 750 standard images (2-3x better than competitors' 200-700 images)
- ✅ Pro ($49/mo): 4,000 fast images OR 1,500 standard images (2-3x better than competitors' 600-1,800 images)
- ✅ Unlimited ($99/mo) beats market average ($119.25/mo)

**Margin Analysis (After Credit Cost Adjustment):**
- Studio Fast: $0.0012 cost → $0.015 price = **12.5x margin** ✅ (was 4.2x)
- Studio Standard: $0.003 cost → $0.040 price = **13.3x margin** ✅ (was 5x)
- Basic: 15,000 credits = $15 value for $14 = **107% value** (still profitable)
- Starter: 30,000 credits = $30 value for $29 = **103% value**
- Pro: 60,000 credits = $60 value for $49 = **122% value**

**Buying Power (After Adjustment):**
- Basic: 1,000 fast images (vs competitors' 100-200) = **5-10x better** ✅ (was 15-30x)
- Starter: 2,000 fast images (vs competitors' 200-700) = **3-10x better** ✅ (was 20-30x)
- Pro: 4,000 fast images (vs competitors' 600-1,800) = **2-7x better** ✅ (was 10-20x)

---

## Option B: Lower Existing Tiers

**Adjust current tiers to be more competitive without adding new tier.**

### Revised Pricing Structure

| Plan | Monthly | Annual | Monthly Credits | Cost/Credit | Change |
|------|---------|--------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| **Free** | $0 | $0 | 500 (one-time) | N/A | No change |
| **Starter** | **$19/mo** | **$139/year** ($11.58/mo) | 30,000 | $0.00063 | **-34% monthly, -30% annual** |
| **Pro** | $49/mo | $349/year ($29.08/mo) | 60,000 | $0.00082 | No change |
| **Unlimited** | $99/mo | $699/year ($58.25/mo) | ∞ | N/A | No change |

**Competitive Positioning:**
- ✅ Starter ($19/mo) beats The Influencer AI ($19) and CreatorCore ($29.95)
- ✅ Annual Starter ($11.58/mo) beats Higgsfield Basic ($9/mo) with more credits
- ✅ Pro remains competitive ($49/mo)

**Margin Analysis:**
- Starter: 30,000 credits = $30 value for $19 = **158% value** (still profitable)
- Pro: 60,000 credits = $60 value for $49 = **122% value**

**Risk**: Lower margins on Starter tier, but still profitable at 4-5x feature margins.

---

## Option C: Hybrid Approach (Balanced)

**Add Basic tier + improve annual discounts on existing tiers.**

### Hybrid Pricing Structure

| Plan | Monthly | Annual | Monthly Credits | Cost/Credit | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|----------------|-------------|-------|
| **Free** | $0 | $0 | 500 (one-time) | N/A | No change |
| **Basic** | **$14/mo** | **$99/year** ($8.25/mo) | 15,000 | $0.00093 | **NEW** |
| **Starter** | $29/mo | **$179/year** ($14.92/mo) | 30,000 | $0.00050 | **-10% annual** |
| **Pro** | $49/mo | **$329/year** ($27.42/mo) | 60,000 | $0.00046 | **-6% annual** |
| **Unlimited** | $99/mo | **$659/year** ($54.92/mo) | ∞ | N/A | **-6% annual** |

**Annual Discounts:**
- Basic: 41% off
- Starter: 49% off (improved from 31%)
- Pro: 44% off (improved from 31%)
- Unlimited: 45% off (improved from 31%)

**Competitive Positioning:**

- ✅ Starter annual ($14.92/mo) beats most competitors
- ✅ Pro annual ($27.42/mo) beats Higgsfield ($29.08/mo)
- ✅ All tiers have competitive annual discounts (40-50%)

---

## Recommended Implementation: Option A (Add Basic Tier)

### Rationale

1. **Captures budget segment** without cannibalizing Starter tier
2. **Maintains Starter positioning** at $29/mo (still competitive)
3. **Improves conversion funnel** (lower barrier to entry)
4. **Preserves margins** (Basic tier still profitable)
5. **Matches market structure** (most competitors have 3-4 tiers)

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Adjust Credit Costs + Add Basic Tier (Week 1-2)

**Code Changes:**
1. **Update Credit Costs** in `libs/shared/src/credits/pricing.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export const FEATURE_CREDITS: Record<FeatureId, FeatureDefinition> = {
     studio_fast: {
       credits: 15, // Increased from 5 (3x)
       // ...
     },
     studio_standard: {
       credits: 40, // Increased from 15 (2.7x)
       // ...
     },
     base_images: {
       credits: 80, // Increased from 30 (2.7x)
       // ...
     },
     profile_set_fast: {
       credits: 120, // Increased from 50 (2.4x)
       // ...
     },
     profile_set_quality: {
       credits: 250, // Increased from 100 (2.5x)
       // ...
     },
   };
   ```

2. **Add Basic Tier** to `PLAN_CREDITS`:
   ```typescript
   export const PLAN_CREDITS: Record<PlanId, PlanDefinition> = {
     // ... existing ...
     basic: {
       id: 'basic',
       name: 'Basic',
       monthlyCredits: 15000,
       priceMonthly: 14,
       priceYearly: 99,
     },
     // ... rest ...
   };
   ```

- Update `SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS` array with Basic tier
- Add Finby product IDs for Basic tier (monthly/yearly)
- Update frontend pricing pages to show 4 tiers
- **Update all credit cost displays** throughout the app

**Finby Setup:**
- Create `basic_monthly` product ($14/mo)
- Create `basic_yearly` product ($99/year)
- Configure subscription billing

**Marketing:**
- Update pricing page with Basic tier
- Highlight "Best Value" on Pro tier
- Emphasize annual savings (41% off)

#### Phase 2: Improve Annual Discounts (Week 2-3)

**Update Annual Pricing:**
- Starter: $199/year → $179/year (49% off)
- Pro: $349/year → $329/year (44% off)
- Unlimited: $699/year → $659/year (45% off)

**Code Changes:**
- Update `priceYearly` in `PLAN_CREDITS`
- Update `priceYearlyPerMonth` calculations
- Update frontend to show improved annual savings

#### Phase 3: Marketing & Positioning (Week 3-4)

**Messaging:**
- "Starting at $14/mo" (vs previous $29/mo)
- "Up to 49% off with annual plans"
- "Best-in-class per-image pricing ($0.005-0.015)"
- "More credits per dollar than competitors"

**Comparison Table:**
- Show RYLA vs competitors side-by-side
- Highlight: "5-15% cheaper than alternatives"
- Emphasize value (credits per dollar)

## Margin Analysis

### Current Margins (Self-Hosted Features)

| Feature | Cost | Price (Credits) | Retail Price | Margin |
|---------|------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| Studio Fast | $0.0012 | 5 credits | $0.005 | **4.2x** |
| Studio Standard | $0.0030 | 15 credits | $0.015 | **5.0x** |
| Base Images (3) | $0.0060 | 30 credits | $0.030 | **5.0x** |
| Profile Set Fast | $0.0115 | 50 credits | $0.050 | **4.3x** |
| Profile Set Quality | $0.0170 | 100 credits | $0.100 | **5.9x** |

**Average Margin: 4.8x** ✅

### Impact of New Basic Tier

**Basic Tier Economics:**
- Price: $14/mo
- Credits: 15,000 credits = $15 retail value
- **Value Ratio: 107%** (user gets $15 value for $14)

**Profitability:**
- At 4.8x average margin, $15 retail value = $3.13 cost
- Revenue: $14/mo
- **Profit: $10.87/mo (78% margin)** ✅

**Conclusion**: Basic tier is still highly profitable even at 107% value ratio.

   - Current: ~70% Starter, ~30% Pro
   - Target: ~40% Basic, ~40% Starter, ~20% Pro (better segmentation)

3. **Annual Plan Adoption**
   - Current: ~20% annual
   - Target: ~40% annual (better discounts)

4. **Revenue per User**
   - Current: Baseline
   - Target: Maintain or increase (volume growth compensates for lower Basic tier)

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Cannibalization of Starter Tier

**Mitigation:**
- Position Basic as "entry level" (15k credits)
- Position Starter as "most popular" (30k credits)
- Emphasize Starter value in marketing

### Risk 2: Lower Margins on Basic Tier

**Mitigation:**
- Basic tier still profitable (78% margin)
- Focus on volume growth
- Upsell to Starter/Pro tiers

### Risk 3: Competitor Response

**Mitigation:**
- RYLA has cost advantage (self-hosted infrastructure)
- Per-image pricing already best-in-class
- Focus on value, not just price
