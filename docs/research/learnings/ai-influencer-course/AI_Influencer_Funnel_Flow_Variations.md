# AI Influencer Funnel Flow Variations

# 3 Variations of AI Influencer Creation Funnel Flows for Smoke Test

These three funnel variations are designed for quick smoke testing to validate user engagement and conversion before full development. Each starts from the CTA click ("Get Started") and ends with a hard paywall, focusing on the core value of AI influencer creation. The flows are built to be implemented rapidly using no-code tools like Carrd, Typeform, or Bubble.

## Variation 1: "Progressive Value Build" Funnel

Core Philosophy: Gradually reveal value through each step, building excitement and investment. Paywall hits after users see their complete influencer but before they can download/use content.

Estimated Completion Time: 12-15 minutes Conversion Goal: 35% reach paywall, 15% convert Best For: Users who need to "feel" the value before committing

    -   Reddit Ads: $100 (r/Entrepreneur, r/passive\_income)
        
    -   Instagram Stories: $100 (creator-focused accounts)
        
-   Target: 500 visitors → 150 funnel starts → 50 paywall reaches
    
-   Success Threshold: 10+ paid conversions ($290+ revenue) = Green light
    

A/B Testing Framework:

-   Test A: Variation 1 (Progressive) vs Test B: Variation 2 (Instant)

-   Winner: Highest revenue per visitor after 7 days

Technical Conversion Boosters:

-   Exit-Intent Popups: 20% lift in email captures

-   One-Click Payments: Apple Pay/Google Pay integration
    

### Expected Outcomes & Next Steps

Validation Success (>10 paid users):

-   Phase 1: Build full AI integration (SeaArt/Kling APIs)
    
-   Phase 2: Add social integrations (Instagram OAuth)
    
-   Phase 3: Launch complete MVP with all 3 funnel variations
    

Validation Failure (<5 paid users):

-   Pivot Analysis: Survey drop-offs (Step 2 = face quality issues?)
    
-   Alternative: Focus on single niche (adult content = highest conversion)
    
-   Re-test: Simplify further (3-step funnel max)
    

Budget Breakdown (Smoke Test):

-   Tools: $150/month (Carrd, Typeform, ConvertKit)
    
-   Content: $200 (pre-generated assets + basic editing)
    
-   Traffic: $500 (Week 1 testing)
    
-   Total: $850 for validation
    

These three variations test different user psychology: progressive commitment (Var 1), instant gratification (Var 2), and decision simplification (Var 3). Run all three simultaneously with $150-200 traffic each to identify the winning approach before full development. The smoke test validates both product-market fit and optimal user flow before investing in complex AI infrastructure.
