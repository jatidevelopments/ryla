## Insights for RYLA

1. **Age Verification**: Since RYLA also generates potentially NSFW or high-risk AI content, a strict Underage Policy or clear 18+ requirements (like the popup on MyDreamCompanion) is recommended.
2. **AI Improvement Clause**: MyDreamCompanion explicitly says they use anonymized data to improve AI models. RYLA should confirm if it does the same and disclose it.
3. **Marketing Pixels**: They list many "adult" or niche ad networks (Juicy Ads, Trafficjunky) which suggests a specific marketing strategy.
4. **Impressum**: Their Impressum is very clean and follows § 5 DDG (formerly TMG) precisely. RYLA's Impressum should mirror this structure.
