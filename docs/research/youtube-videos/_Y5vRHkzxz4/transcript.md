## Key Quotes

> "When I first started learning how to create AI influencers, it took me literally months to get to where I am now."

> "The biggest problem on the beginning was that I was extremely overwhelmed. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what model to use. I didn't know what was Comfy UI."

> "If you have never done anything like this, you are going to have a lot of errors, lot of problems, a lot of dependency problems."

> "The goal of this video is to go from this [fake looking] to this [realistic]."

> "LoRA training is basically that you take the entire image model then you add like 20 or 50 images depending on what model are you using."

> "Garbage in equals garbage out. If you have a [bad] data set and [bad] prompt, you will get [bad] results."

> "In the end, it is just a numbers game. So if you have [bad] settings, if you have [bad] model, if you have [bad] prompt, even then you can get a good image, but you are going to have to generate 1,000 images and one of them will be good."
