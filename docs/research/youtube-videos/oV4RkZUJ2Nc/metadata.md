## Summary

Analysis of top 7 successful AI influencers (including Aitana Lopez) to identify common success factors. Found three critical elements: niche/story, consistency, and visual coherence.

Key findings:
1. **Niche Required**: Must have a story/character (gym girl, robot girl, Indian girl, etc.)
2. **Consistency**: Long-term presence (1,700+ posts, 900+ posts) - not get-rich-quick
3. **Visual Coherence**: Variety with consistent style (pink hair, Indian outfits, etc.)

Important insight: "Don't be an artist" - don't spend 500 hours perfecting images. Better to have decent images with good marketing than perfect images with no reach.

## Key Points

- **Story Essential**: Character must have identity, backstory, personality
- **Long-Term Game**: Success takes months/years, not weeks
- **Content Plan**: Need strategy for lifestyle photos, day-in-life, engagement
- **Visual Identity**: Consistent style while maintaining variety
- **Quality vs Marketing**: Marketing > perfection
