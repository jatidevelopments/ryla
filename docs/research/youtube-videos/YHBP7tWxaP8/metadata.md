## Summary

Comprehensive Instagram marketing guide for AI influencers, covering account creation, warm-up, posting strategies, promotions, hashtags, and character development. Emphasizes that marketing is more important than image quality - "best pictures + bad marketing = bad results" while "okay pictures + good marketing = good results."

- **Stories & Threads**: Best for engagement and account health
- **Character Bible**: Essential document with all character details
- **Promotions**: Can work but risk becoming "promotional slave"
