## Summary

Comprehensive guide on creating viral videos for AI influencers using the latest video generation models. The video demonstrates how video generation technology has advanced dramatically (comparing Will Smith eating spaghetti from 3 years ago vs. Clink 2.6 from December 2025), and provides step-by-step workflows for three types of videos: dancing videos, image-to-video edited content, and talking head videos.

### Key Workflows Covered:

1. **Dancing Videos**: Using Clink Motion Control to replicate TikTok dance videos with AI characters
2. **Image-to-Video Editing**: Creating Instagram Reels/TikToks by generating multiple image-to-video clips and editing them together in CapCut
3. **Talking Head Videos**: Generating voice with 11 Labs, then lip-syncing with Clink Avatars 2.0

### Key Insights:

- **Input Quality is Critical**: "Garbage in, garbage out" - video quality depends entirely on input image quality
- **Model Selection**: Clink 2.6, Clink 01, Sora, and VO 3.1 are the best models currently available
- **Provider Recommendation**: Wave Speed AI recommended for best prices (vs. Hicksfield "scam" and Full AAI "too slow")
- **Content Strategy > Model Quality**: Controversial/emotional content gets more views than perfect technical quality
- **Iteration Required**: Expect to generate 4 videos to get 1 good one, then edit in CapCut
- **Quality Control**: Never post fake-looking videos - it can destroy your influencer's reputation

## Key Points

### Video Generation Models:
- **Clink 2.6 Motion Control**: Best for dancing videos, replicates hand gestures and complex motions
- **Clink 2.6 / Clink 01**: Image-to-video generation
- **Sora**: Image-to-video generation
- **VO 3.1**: Image-to-video generation
- **Clink Avatars 2.0**: Best for lip-sync/talking head videos
- **One Infinite Talk**: Alternative for talking videos (sometimes works)
- **One 2.5 Speak**: Middle ground for talking videos (inconsistent results)

### Tools & Providers:
- **Wave Speed AI**: Recommended provider (best prices, good speed)
- **11 Labs**: Voice generation for talking videos
- **CapCut**: Video editing software for combining clips
- **Hicksfield**: Avoid (described as "scam with credits")
- **Full AAI**: Avoid (too slow)

### Three Types of Videos:

1. **Dancing Videos**:
   - Download TikTok video with dance
   - Use Clink Motion Control on Wave Speed
   - Input your AI character image + reference video
   - Get output with character performing the dance

2. **Image-to-Video Edited Videos**:
   - Generate multiple image-to-video clips from character images
   - Edit together in CapCut
   - Add text, music, transitions
   - Use cases: workout videos, "get ready with me", skincare routines, "day in the life"
   - Most versatile and creative option

3. **Talking Head Videos**:
   - Generate voice with 11 Labs (write text → enhance → generate)
   - Use Clink Avatars 2.0 for lip-sync (10-second limit per clip)
   - Combine multiple clips for longer videos
   - Use cases: stories, controversial topics, daily updates

### Best Practices:

- **Start with Quality Images**: All videos are image-based, so input image quality determines output quality
- **Test Multiple Models**: Different models work better for different scenarios (close-ups vs. full body, static vs. movement)
- **Edit in Post**: Always edit in CapCut to remove weird movements, add overlays, transitions
- **Content Strategy**: Focus on emotional/controversial content that gets engagement, not just technical perfection
- **Quality Control**: Never post fake-looking videos - better to post no video than a bad one
- **Iteration**: Generate 4 videos, pick the best one, edit it
