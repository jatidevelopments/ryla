[0:00] What's up, guys? Welcome to another video. And in today's video, I want to talk about the best ways to create viral videos for your AI influencers. As you have probably noticed, the technology is getting more and more advanced and you can create super realistic videos. And for comparison, just so you know how much the models have advanced, I want to show you a Reddit post that has a video comparing Will Smith eating spaghetti three years ago versus now. We can look

[0:31] at this and you see on the left we have the old video models and you can see that it was not quite realistic but on the right side we have cling 2.6 six model which is like December launched model in 2025 and you see that compared to the left side it is extremely realistic. So as you can see the videos have got so advanced that it is almost undistinguishable from reality and you must use this for your advantage for your AI influencers. And in this video I'm going to teach you how. I'm going to

[1:04] walk you step by step. I'm going to show you what types of videos there are and I'm gonna actually show you how you can create similar videos yourself without any technical skills and without using Confi. So before we actually start with the videos, let's talk about why you should even want to create videos where obviously you have more reach. You can use reals, you can use Tik Toks, you can use YouTube shorts, and your AI influencer will look more realistic if

[1:32] you have images and videos than if you only had images. And you obviously will have more content ideas because you can do all sorts of stuff. The only thing you should think about is that you should be really careful when doing it because let's say for example, you are running a page with your AI influencer and you have only images that are realistic. You can absolutely ruin your page by putting a fake video. So, it is better to put out no video than a fake video. But the tools are so advanced

[2:01] right now that it's impossible to do a fake video. So, before we get to the tools, we have to talk about what types of videos we can create. There are three ways we can do it. You can actually download a Tik Tok video where someone is dancing and you can replicate it with your AI character. Then you can use imagetovideo models and edit them. That means that you are going to take a lots of images of your AI influencers. Then you are going to make them into motion.

[2:26] Then you are going to open cap cut and then you are going to cut it next to each other and add some text and music. And the third part you can do is talking videos and lip sync where you can actually make your AI influencer talk. So the start of all videos is you have to realize that all the videos you create are based from the image. So if your image is your video will be  If your image is great and you do great prompt, then you will have a great video. So this is the golden rule in all

[2:57] of AI. And it doesn't matter if it's GPT prompts or video prompts. The rule is garbage in garbage out. So if your input image is garbage, your output video will be garbage. Keep this in mind. And now we are getting to the first section of the videos and those are dancing videos. Previously, we had one animate which I actually made an air table for where you could input a video from Tik Tok. Then you would input your AI character, then it would get the cover image from the

[3:28] Tik Tok, then it would face swap and then it would actually make the dancing video with your character. The only downside of it is that you had to do this super complicated process of actually swapping the face and sometimes the movements did not look too real. But now we have much better model. We have cling motion control which does pretty much the same thing but without all of the complications and with much better quality. And we can actually see at the official Clink website that the model

[4:01] has like super advanced capabilities and you can like edit it into pretty much anything. And you see it is replicating the hand gestures. It has like better movements of the complex motions. It has better precision. So I highly recommend you checking out this model if you want to create dancing videos. And if you want to use it, the process is actually extremely simple. You just go to wave speed to Clink 2.6 Pro Motion Control. You input your image. You input the

[4:27] video that you want to replicate and you will get a reference video outputed that is based on your AI character which has the movements based from the video. So now we are moving away from the dancing videos to the actually most useful stuff that you will I believe use the most if you actually decide to create videos of your AI influencers because this will give you the most amount of control. you have the maximum amount of creativity and you can get the best quality this

[4:56] way and it is imagetovideo edit. Actually if you look at the Instagram videos, Instagram reals and Tik Toks where there is just more than dancing you will see that it is just a lot of videos edited and made together and you can actually dissect it. The best models right now that we have are cling 2.6, clink01, sora and vo 3.1. And the process of it is actually extremely simple. Only thing you do is that you create a few image to video videos. You edit it. You add some text and some

[5:29] music and you are done. That's it. You don't have to do anything else. So now I'm in Caput and you see that I have like many videos of random my AI influencer doing some stupid things. So what I can actually do is I can just drag and drop it, you know, to see what happens and somehow combine it. So it is a little bit normal. Then like check the parts from the video that look at least a little bit realistic. So let's say I'm going to use this part. I'm going to

[6:00] delete this. Then from here I'm going to use this one. And from here I'm going to use well this is a bad video so I'm going to use something else. Yeah. And we can use this one for example where she like puts the hands over her face. And now like we have a base for a video, right? This what I'm showing you is not a production ready video. I only want to show you the actual process that you can do, but you can insert much better video clips than I'm showing right now. The only reason

[6:33] why I'm showing this right now is to give you an idea what you can actually do. I'm just using the video clips I have downloaded in my computer. So it makes at least a little bit of sense. And now what you can do is for example to go here you can put some text and it will be gym get ready with me you know for example you make it bold you make it a little bit more visible you stretch it out you know then we can cut it here and then you know she will go to the gym you

[7:02] can put some music and then you will get a full video of your AI influencer that you know you can add voice you can add music you can add whatever you want and then you are going to get a fullblown video. And here the best thing is that the possibilities are literally limitless. You can generate a million pictures of your AI influencer from gym and just boom boom boom put it together and you get a for example a workout video or you can get a get ready with me

[7:30] video or you can get a skincare video or you can get I don't know walking my dog video or you can like combine it. Get some dancing videos then get something from the gym. you combine it and you do like typical day in the life of your AI influencer. So here the possibilities are literally limitless. And as I've talked about these models, Clink 2.6, Clink 01, Sora, and VO. These are the actual models that are doing the heavy lifting. And there are actually three

[7:55] providers that you can use for them that I know of that are the most popular. I highly recommend that you will use Wave Speed AI because they have the best prices. I'm actually not even affiliated with them, but I'm actually using it myself because Hicksfield is just a scam with credits and full AAI is okay, but it is extremely slow. So, for me, I'm actually using Wave Speed. It is working just fine. And the last type of videos I want to talk about is the talking head

[8:21] videos. It can be great for, you know, talking about some stories, talking about controversial stuff and, you know, whatever. You can, you know, make her talk about her day. It doesn't matter. And the process is actually simple as well. First of all, what you're going to do is you have to generate a voice. So the actual process of generating a voice is extremely simple. I have a full tutorial on this if you want to watch it. But basically the only thing you are going to do is go

[8:46] to 11 Labs. You are going to write some text. You are going to enhance it. You are going to generate. And now you have the speech for your videos. >> So welcome to my Instagram. I guess this is it now. >> Yes. So you see this is the voice and now the only thing you do is you use some image to video tool and you will lip-s sync it. You can do it multiple times because most of the times the lip sync models only supports 10-second videos and then you are done and you

[9:16] have your lip sync video ready and to show you an example like what I did previously you see I uploaded a image of my influencer I have used clink avatars 2.0 O model and I just clicked generate and this is the result I've got. It's extremely simple. >> Guys, I just discovered this guy, Philillip, AI influencer expert. I can't believe it. He is so smart, handsome, [clears throat] and muscular. Wow. >> So, yeah, this is it. And now you can like post it. If you want to create a

[9:51] longer video, you either create a longer voice message and chop it up or you create a longer voice message. And the best models for this right now are the Clink Avatars 2.0. That's what I use the most. Then one infinite talk is okay sometimes. And one 2.5 speak is like something in the middle. Sometimes I get good results with it, sometimes not. So most of the time it's just, you know, about the testing, seeing like what is best and what works best for you, you

[10:17] know, because like some of the models are better at close-ups, other models are better when, you know, you are moving, other models are better when you are far away. So it really just comes to the individual video. So for conclusion, the last points I want to tell you before you start creating a videos that will get you super high views on Instagram and Tik Tok is that you have to acknowledge that it's not that much about the model itself. It's more like about the idea you have. Because like if

[10:45] you are going to create a basic dancing video with the best quality, best model, best workflow, best everything and it's going to be just basic, then it's going to get no views, right? But I don't know if you create like something super controversial where you do a for example transformation from fat girl to skinny girl and you put some commentary over it and you say something controversial that she I don't know only ate spinach and she lost all of this weight then people

[11:12] are going to comment on it and they are get and and you are going to get super high views this way and it doesn't have to be the highest quality because you are going to summon emotions in people. Also, make sure to not destroy your profile. So, if you somehow manage to generate fake videos, don't post them because it can literally destroy your reputation. And last thing you need to know is don't expect that you are going to be able to generate all of those videos on one click. Look, those AI

[11:42] models, they are advanced. They are really advanced. And you have seen the spaghetti eating video that it has come a long way. But it is still only a generative AI. It is still not perfect. So what you must expect from it is not not that you click once and you get the best image instantly, but more like that you click four times, you get four videos and one of them will be the best and that's the one you are going to use. And then you are probably going to have

[12:11] to open Cap Cut anyways or any other editing software and you know edit it a bit. If there is some weird movement then cut it out. add some overlay, add some, you know, transition, whatever, and this will get you the best video. I think there are some like AI editing softwares right now that can do it for you, but it doesn't take that long to edit a stupid dancing video to make it look more realistic. So, I highly recommend putting an actual effort to those videos because this is going to

[12:40] get you the best results.

[13:10] image creation. Because as I said, even if you just want to create videos, you need to get a high quality image because most of the models are image to video.
