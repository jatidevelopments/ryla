[0:01] How do you get a new product off the
[0:01] How do you get a new product off the
[0:03] ground? And when you're just starting
[0:03] ground? And when you're just starting
[0:05] out, where do those first real users
[0:05] out, where do those first real users
[0:07] actually come from? You see, most people
[0:07] actually come from? You see, most people
[0:10] aren't early adopters. Ask yourself, how
[0:10] aren't early adopters. Ask yourself, how
[0:11] many products do you use today that you
[0:11] many products do you use today that you
[0:14] were among the first 10 users of? For
[0:14] were among the first 10 users of? For
[0:16] most people, the answer is zero. Almost
[0:16] most people, the answer is zero. Almost
[0:17] no one wants to be a startup's first
[0:18] no one wants to be a startup's first
[0:19] paying customer. Yet, every great
[0:19] paying customer. Yet, every great
[0:21] product still manages to find a few
[0:21] product still manages to find a few
[0:23] people willing to take that leap. The
[0:23] people willing to take that leap. The
[0:25] earliest version of your product only
[0:25] earliest version of your product only
[0:28] needs to do one thing. survive contact
[0:28] needs to do one thing. survive contact
[0:29] with a tiny group of people who might
[0:30] with a tiny group of people who might
[0:31] actually try it. You're not building the
[0:31] actually try it. You're not building the
[0:33] final form. You're building something
[0:33] final form. You're building something
[0:35] that can evolve. When you're starting
[0:35] that can evolve. When you're starting
[0:37] out, you don't just need a minimum
[0:37] out, you don't just need a minimum
[0:39] viable product. You need a minimum
[0:39] viable product. You need a minimum
[0:41] evolvable product. And I'm going to show
[0:41] evolvable product. And I'm going to show
[0:48] Before you get discouraged, there are
[0:48] Before you get discouraged, there are
[0:50] people who love being early adopters.
[0:50] people who love being early adopters.
[0:51] One of my colleagues, Gustaf, worked at
[0:51] One of my colleagues, Gustaf, worked at
[0:53] Airbnb for years and enjoyed trying out
[0:53] Airbnb for years and enjoyed trying out
[0:54] products from startups and bringing them
[0:54] products from startups and bringing them
[0:56] into the company. Others have such a
[0:56] into the company. Others have such a
[0:58] burning issue that they're willing to
[0:58] burning issue that they're willing to
[1:00] give any new product a shot if it looks
[1:00] give any new product a shot if it looks
[1:01] like it could make their life easier.
[1:01] like it could make their life easier.
[1:03] For example, when my team needed to ship
[1:03] For example, when my team needed to ship
[1:04] our first inference API, we wanted to
[1:04] our first inference API, we wanted to
[1:06] ship it fast and didn't want to deal
[1:06] ship it fast and didn't want to deal
[1:07] with figuring out billing or public
[1:07] with figuring out billing or public
[1:09] endpoint. Within 3 days, I found and
[1:09] endpoint. Within 3 days, I found and
[1:11] paid a startup whose product solved that
[1:11] paid a startup whose product solved that
[1:12] issue for us. I was their first
[1:12] issue for us. I was their first
[1:14] customer. Their size or reputation
[1:14] customer. Their size or reputation
[1:16] didn't matter. Our problem did, so we
[1:16] didn't matter. Our problem did, so we
[1:17] took a chance on them, and they
[1:17] took a chance on them, and they
[1:19] delivered. The lesson is simple. Finding
[1:19] delivered. The lesson is simple. Finding
[1:21] your first users is more of a search
[1:21] your first users is more of a search
[1:23] problem than a persuasion problem.

[1:26] Ankits of the world, the ones who try
[1:26] Ankits of the world, the ones who try
[1:28] new things or have a burning need that
[1:28] new things or have a burning need that
[1:29] you can solve. This has a few
[1:29] you can solve. This has a few
[1:31] counterintuitive implications that

[1:52] Use targeted personal outreach. The ways
[1:52] Use targeted personal outreach. The ways
[1:53] you find these people probably don't

[2:03] Launch early. This is something YC has
[2:03] Launch early. This is something YC has
[2:04] preached from the beginning. In the
[2:04] preached from the beginning. In the
[2:05] early days, you don't know much about
[2:05] early days, you don't know much about
[2:07] who these early users are, and [music]
[2:07] who these early users are, and [music]
[2:09] you want to engineer a wide surface area
[2:09] you want to engineer a wide surface area
[2:11] for them to find you. Study your early
[2:11] for them to find you. Study your early
[2:13] users closely. You should be like an
[2:13] users closely. You should be like an
[2:14] anthropologist that's [music] discovered
[2:14] anthropologist that's [music] discovered
[2:17] a hidden civilization. How do they make
[2:17] a hidden civilization. How do they make
[2:18] decisions? Why would they make the
[2:18] decisions? Why would they make the
[2:20] strange choice to trust you? You want to
[2:20] strange choice to trust you? You want to
[2:21] understand how they think and what they
[2:21] understand how they think and what they
[2:24] want. Experiment fast and don't fear
[2:24] want. Experiment fast and don't fear
[2:26] churn. You should be running constant
[2:26] churn. You should be running constant
[2:28] experiments, pricing, landing pages,
[2:28] experiments, pricing, landing pages,
[2:30] onboarding, features, everything. At the
[2:30] onboarding, features, everything. At the
[2:32] same time, talk to your early users and
[2:32] same time, talk to your early users and
[2:34] try to make them love the product. But
[2:34] try to make them love the product. But
[2:35] don't stress if you lose one of them. If
[2:35] don't stress if you lose one of them. If
[2:37] you annoy someone, you can usually fix
[2:37] you annoy someone, you can usually fix
[2:39] it because the relationship is personal.
[2:39] it because the relationship is personal.
[2:40] And if they churn, that's fine, too.

[2:41] There are plenty of others who haven't
[2:41] There are plenty of others who haven't
[2:43] even heard of you yet. This is one of
[2:43] even heard of you yet. This is one of
[2:45] the advantages startups have over big

[2:48] You're fighting irrelevance, not

[2:50] headlines. All of this may shape who
[2:50] headlines. All of this may shape who
[2:51] you're even building for in the
[2:51] you're even building for in the
[2:53] beginning. Most people don't pay for a
[2:53] beginning. Most people don't pay for a
[2:55] bunch of consumer apps. The average
[2:55] bunch of consumer apps. The average
[2:56] personal software spend is [music]
[2:56] personal software spend is [music]
[2:58] pretty tiny. For example, mine's about
[2:58] pretty tiny. For example, mine's about
[3:00] $150 a month total. Meanwhile, my
[3:00] $150 a month total. Meanwhile, my
[3:02] corporate card has multiple tools that
[3:02] corporate card has multiple tools that
[3:04] each cost more than that alone. In the
[3:04] each cost more than that alone. In the
[3:06] AI era, that gap matters. Consumer apps
[3:06] AI era, that gap matters. Consumer apps
[3:08] can struggle because ads often don't

[3:15] companies will still be made, but this

[3:20] by selling to proumers or businesses or
[3:20] by selling to proumers or businesses or
[3:21] targeting users like doctors that have
[3:22] targeting users like doctors that have
[3:24] high advertising value. This leads us to
[3:24] high advertising value. This leads us to
[3:26] an even bigger point. Your early users
[3:26] an even bigger point. Your early users
[3:27] don't just give you feedback. They end
[3:27] don't just give you feedback. They end
[3:29] up steering how your product evolves
[3:29] up steering how your product evolves
[3:31] over time. Here's an analogy I use to
[3:31] over time. Here's an analogy I use to
[3:33] help founders think about their first
[3:33] help founders think about their first
[3:34] users. Think of a startup as a
[3:34] users. Think of a startup as a
[3:37] phoggenetic tree. Okay, bear with me.

[3:39] The root nodes in amoeba and the leaf
[3:39] The root nodes in amoeba and the leaf
[3:40] nodes are complex multisellular
[3:40] nodes are complex multisellular
[3:43] organisms like humans or dogs. Almost

[4:07] Consider Tesla as a case study,
[4:07] Consider Tesla as a case study,
[4:09] specifically their amoeba, the Tesla
[4:09] specifically their amoeba, the Tesla
[4:11] Roadster. The lore about the Roadster is
[4:11] Roadster. The lore about the Roadster is
[4:13] that Tesla needed a high margin product
[4:13] that Tesla needed a high margin product
[4:15] to fund their capex investment to make
[4:15] to fund their capex investment to make
[4:17] the Model S and eventually the Model 3
[4:17] the Model S and eventually the Model 3
[4:19] and Y. That's probably true, but there's
[4:19] and Y. That's probably true, but there's
[4:21] a second interpretation. Tesla was
[4:21] a second interpretation. Tesla was
[4:23] searching for early adopters. They
[4:23] searching for early adopters. They
[4:24] wanted to find the people crazy enough

[4:36] evolution is path dependent on what the
[4:36] evolution is path dependent on what the
[4:38] early adopters wanted. Why does the

[4:40] Tesla Model Y, a mass market vehicle,
[4:42] have a faster 0 to 60 than a Lamborghini
[4:42] have a faster 0 to 60 than a Lamborghini
[4:45] and better tech than a BMW, but worse
[4:45] and better tech than a BMW, but worse
[4:47] suspension and comfort than a Toyota? It

[4:49] turns out that early adopters cared much
[4:49] turns out that early adopters cared much
[4:51] more about tech and acceleration than
[4:51] more about tech and acceleration than
[4:53] comfort. Would a mass market vehicle

[4:55] designed in a vacuum have a 0 to 60 of
[4:55] designed in a vacuum have a 0 to 60 of
[4:58] under 3 seconds? Probably not. But it's
[4:58] under 3 seconds? Probably not. But it's
[4:59] an outcome of the search algorithm that
[4:59] an outcome of the search algorithm that
[5:01] Tesla ran. If early adopters were
[5:01] Tesla ran. If early adopters were
[5:04] willing to pay $150,000 for a slow,

[5:06] plush vehicle, I bet Tesla's cars would
[5:08] look very different today. This is the
[5:08] look very different today. This is the
[5:10] algorithm we help founders run at YC.

[5:11] And it's why your first version
[5:11] And it's why your first version
[5:13] shouldn't just be a minimum viable
[5:13] shouldn't just be a minimum viable
[5:15] product. It should be a minimum
[5:15] product. It should be a minimum
[5:17] evolvable product. Something simple that
[5:17] evolvable product. Something simple that
[5:18] can respond to market pressures and
[5:18] can respond to market pressures and
[5:20] evolve into a much more mature product.
