[0:00] What's up guys? Welcome to another video. And in today's video, I want to talk about the most complex and controversial topic and that is are loras and comfy still relevant in today's age. The thing is that the models that the API models like Nanobana Pro are getting better and better every [ __ ] month. So if you would ask me this question six months ago, I would say yes 100% you need Loras and Confy to get good results. If you would ask me this question one month ago, I would say mostly yes. But if you want to get 80% quality for zero effort, then you do not need to learn those things. Today I'm going to say that if you want to generate just say for work images and you are okay with getting just 90% of the quality instead 100% of the quality. Let's say this is the 90% quality. As you can see it's not bad and this is 100% quality. This is much better as you can see. So if you are okay with getting just 90% of the quality then you don't need loras and confi. But there are many pluses and minuses for each of those paths. So let's quickly get over all of these so you can actually make an informed decision based on your time your budget and your needs. So before we start, you have to realize that there are basically two parts. There are two types of image and video models. Either it is open source. So it means that you can download the model to your computer and run it there completely for free or you can rent a GPU on a cloud and run the model there for free. You just pay for the GPU or there is another way that you can use those API models which means that the model runs somewhere on Google server or what or wherever else and you don't need to do anything. You just you just tell him okay generate me image of this girl and he will input it back to you. So let's get over the specifics so you are able to make an informed decision if you are going to learn confi and train your own lora or if you are just going to stick to the API models. So talking about the opensource models the upside is that you can run it locally. It is pretty much free and you can do unlimited customization in confi. You can add loras and the biggest upside is that it supports high quality not safe for work images. Yes, for example in API models, Cdream also supports not safe for work images, but the quality is not as good as you can have in your comi. The minuses is that you need to learn at least the basics of conf. It has a super long and steep learning curve. If you don't have an IT background and you have never done this before, it's not going to take you weeks to set up everything and to understand everything. It's going to take you literally months. So, if you have the time and you want to get the best quality for sure, but the thing that you have to realize is that there are literally 1,000 things that you can [ __ ] up. And if you [ __ ] it up, you are going to have pain. You are going to have problems. you will want to quit but trust me I had the same process as you and I just kept asking AI okay I have this error what should I do do this it doesn't work well I then I asked it again again and again and after few months I got the basic understanding on of confi custom nodes models and trainings and if we go about the basics of API models well the setup is instant you can just load up Gemini you can load up nanobanana proced boom give him an prompt and you will get an image back. It's that simple. You don't need any technical skills and you can literally do it now. There is nothing to [ __ ] up. Literally nothing. The minuses is that it just gives you 90% of the quality but it keeps getting better. 3 months ago or four months ago, we've got Nano Banana which was good. Now we've got Nano Banana Pro which is extremely good. and I don't even want to know what's going to be next. The other downsides is that there is nothing to customize and it will not generate you as quality not safe for work images as the open-source models. The reason for it is that you have to realize what is the model trained on. There should be a base model, not based model. What is the base model trained on? If it's trained on normal images, let's say for example from internet, from Instagram and from I don't know Facebook, then it will give you good safe formal images. But if it has never seen a nude body and other things that I cannot talk about on YouTube, then there is no way that they are going to be consistent. So if you are just starting out, I would definitely start with the API models. But if you want to get more advanced, I would definitely start experimenting with comfy because you are not going to need it in the long run. And you also have to decide like what is your use case? Do you just do you just want to do it for fun? Then yes, Nano Banana Pro will be enough. But do you want to sell pictures to other people on the internet that you want to fool them that it is realistic? Then you have to decide if your ideal customer will just say, "Oh this looks good. I'm going to buy her news or if he's going to be okay, this looks good. Let me inspect closely if this image is actually real or it is AI. I'll give you a hint. Most people don't do what I just did. Okay. And moving into number two, as I said, you have to decide if you are okay with just 90% of the quality or 100% of the quality. So if no one is just going to zoom into the pictures and check if the eyes have the same I don't know whatever then you are definitely okay with such pictures but if you want to generate the best pictures possible then you definitely need to learn some conf and you definitely need to learn how can you train a Laura model. Point number three is that you have to choose your price. As I said, those image models on the cloud, on the servers, those API models are paid and you are either going to pay 3 cents from 3 cents to 15 cents per image, but it's going to be instant. You can do it right now, or you can actually use those open-source free models, but it's not going to be instant. If you have never done this before, it's going to take you literally weeks or months to get some normal image quality to actually understand everything. But once you learn it, you will never have to pay anything again. So if you have a giant budget and you you do not have a lot of time and you are not a technical person I would definitely go with the API models. But if you don't have a lot of money and you have a lot of time, I would definitely start learning Comfy and Loras to actually invest your time. Point number four, you have to realize is that it keeps evolving, but it keeps evolving exponentially. If I should use this graph to represent it, well, we can say that the basic Nano Banana was somewhere around here, but the Nano Banana Pro is not linear, is not here. The Nanobanana Pro is here. And the quality just keeps getting [ __ ] better and better. And like I s I sincerely believe that in like two to three years we will never need anything resembling comfy UI because those image edit models are going to be so [ __ ] great. They are going to be so [ __ ] optimized that you will definitely not need a comfy UI. The only thing that we are missing right now is not safe for work in those API models. So once some Chinese company releases a open-source image edit model that will be in the same quality as Nanovana Pro, we are done. That's it. So how should you choose step number five? Well, it depends as always. I highly recommend that if you are just starting out and you are not a technical person, I would definitely start with the API models. But if you know you want to do this for the long run, if you know you want to get the best quality, if you want you want to generate a consistent not safe for work images and everything, I would definitely suggest to you to learn comfy and some loras. If you actually decide to use conf and Laura and to learn it, I highly recommend you watch my ultimate AI influencer creation guide, which is 36 minutes. And if you actually decide to train a Laura model, I highly recommend you watch the most comprehensive Laura training tutorial. But if you just want to generate some images and post them and you are not a technical person and you don't want to spend a lot of time on it, I highly recommend you just set up the new free table automation that also supports no safe for work and nanobana pro which will get you 90% there in just a few minutes.
