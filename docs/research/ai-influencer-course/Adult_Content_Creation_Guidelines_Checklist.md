# Adult Content Creation Guidelines Checklist

### Simple Adult Content Creator Guidelines: Do's and Don'ts Checklist

Hey there! If you're creating adult content (like 18+ videos, photos, or stories) and both you and your audience are cool with it, that's great—but platforms and laws have rules to keep things safe, legal, and fair for everyone. This is a straightforward checklist of what's usually allowed and not, based on common guidelines from sites like YouTube, Patreon, and payment processors. It's not legal advice, just helpful tips to avoid issues. Always check your platform's specific terms (e.g., no hardcore stuff on mainstream sites) and get consent from anyone involved. Focus on fun, respectful content that respects boundaries.

I've kept it super simple: Do's for what to do, Don'ts for what to skip. Use this to double-check your work before posting.

#### Do's: Keep It Legal, Safe, and Cool

-   ☐ Get clear consent: Always ask and record permission from everyone in your content—verbal, written, or on camera. No surprises!
    
-   ☐ Verify ages: Make sure all participants are 18+ (or legal age in your area). Double-check IDs if needed.
    
-   ☐ Label it properly: Tag your content as "18+" or "adult" so only the right people see it. Use warnings like "Not for minors."
    
-   ☐ Respect privacy: Blur faces or use pseudonyms if someone wants anonymity. Never share personal info without okay.
    
-   ☐ Be honest about what it is: Describe your content clearly (e.g., "solo video" vs. something more intense) so fans know what they're getting.
    
-   ☐ Use safe payment options: Pick adult-friendly processors (like those for OnlyFans) that don't freeze accounts—avoid mainstream banks if they ban adult stuff.
    
-   ☐ Build a positive community: Encourage respectful comments, block creeps, and promote body positivity or education.
    

#### Don'ts: Avoid These to Stay Out of Trouble

-   ☐ ❌ No underage anything: Zero tolerance—don't even joke about it. Platforms ban accounts fast.
    
-   ☐ ❌ No non-consensual content: Never share revenge porn, hidden cams, or anything without full agreement. It's illegal in most places.
    
-   ☐ ❌ No violence or harm: Skip anything that looks abusive, forced, or dangerous—even if it's "acting." Safety first.
    
-   ☐ ❌ No illegal acts: Don't include drugs, weapons, or anything against the law (e.g., no real bestiality or trafficking vibes).
    
-   ☐ ❌ No hate or discrimination: Avoid content that targets race, gender, orientation, etc., in a harmful way—keep it inclusive and fun.
    
-   ☐ ❌ No misleading stuff: Don't fake ages, steal others' work, or promise what you won't deliver. Be real to keep fans happy.
    
-   ☐ ❌ No spamming or scams: Don't use bots, fake reviews, or pressure for payments outside safe channels.
    

Stick to this, and you'll create content that's exciting without the headaches. For adult creators, places like Patreon have specific AI and content rules too—check their help pages. If you need tips for a certain platform or more details, just ask! Stay safe and have fun. 😊
