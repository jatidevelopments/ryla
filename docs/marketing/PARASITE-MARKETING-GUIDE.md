### Solution: Multi-Layer Keyword Research

| | "make money OnlyFans anonymously" | Medium | Medium | 🔴 P0 |
| **Tool Discovery** | "best AI tool for OnlyFans creators" | Low | Low | 🟡 P1 |

| **Tutorial** | "how to make AI OnlyFans content" | Low | Low | 🔴 P0 |

## Part 2: Platform Access Strategy

### Challenge: Getting Approved/Published

**Problem**: High-authority platforms have strict approval processes, spam filters, and content policies.
