## RunPod Safety Policy (MANDATORY)

This repository treats RunPod infrastructure as **production-like**. The agent must follow the rules below for **any** RunPod-related action (including via MCP servers, CLI, API calls, dashboards, or SDKs).

### Hard Rules

1. **CONFIRMATION REQUIRED (ALWAYS)**
   - Before **any** RunPod action (even read/list), the agent must ask the user to confirm.
   - The confirmation prompt must include:
     - The **exact resource IDs** that would be touched (endpoint/pod/volume/job).
     - The **exact operation** (create/list/update/etc.).
     - Whether the resource is **new (created in this session / in ledger)** or **pre-existing**.

2. **CREATE-ONLY (NO CHANGES TO EXISTING RESOURCES)**
   - The agent must **never modify, stop, update, or delete** any pre-existing RunPod resources.
   - **Read-only inspection** (list/get) is allowed **only** to gather IDs/config needed to create new resources, and still requires confirmation.
   - Only resources explicitly created for RYLA during this project work may be operated on (including start/stop), and only after confirmation.

3. **DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS FORBIDDEN**
   - The agent must never perform (or propose) destructive actions:
     - delete/remove/destroy/terminate/stop/archive/cleanup
     - scale-down-to-zero if it implies shutdown/termination
     - wiping volumes, deleting endpoints, removing templates
   - If the user asks for destructive actions, the agent must **STOP** and ask for explicit override wording + exact IDs.

4. **LEDGER REQUIRED**
   - Every created RunPod resource must be recorded in `docs/ops/runpod/RESOURCES.md` immediately after creation:
     - name, type, id, region, created_at, purpose, creator (tool), notes
   - If it’s not in the ledger, treat it as **pre-existing** → **do not touch**.

### Default Behavior

- If unsure whether an operation is safe → **assume NOT safe** and ask.
- Prefer “dry-run” explanations (what would be done) over execution.

### Naming Prefix

- Use the prefix: `ryla-prod-guarded-`
