# Way of Work

## Communication Style

### Efficiency First
- Every message = cost (human time / AI tokens)
- Be concise, not verbose
- Async by default, sync when blocked

### Documentation Style
- On point, not full sentences
- Bullet points > paragraphs
- Examples > explanations
- Keep detail needed for clarity

## Naming Conventions

### Branches
```
<type>/<issue-id>-<short-description>

### Commits
```
