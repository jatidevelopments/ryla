# Way of Work

## Communication = Cost
- Every message costs time (human) / tokens (AI)
- Say only what moves work forward
- No filler, repetition, emotional padding
- One line if possible
- Enough clarity to avoid follow-ups

## Style
- Bullet points > paragraphs
- Examples > explanations
- Async by default

## Naming

**Branches**: `feat/RYLA-XX-description`
**Commits**: `feat(scope): description [#RYLA-XX]`
**Issues**: `[FEATURE] Short description`

**Types**: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore

## Slack Formats
```
STATUS: RYLA-42 in-progress
DONE: RYLA-42 implemented
BLOCKED: RYLA-42 waiting on spec
DEPLOY: staging v1.2.3 success
LEARNING: testing - mock at boundaries
```
