# Code Style Rules

## Naming
- camelCase: variables, functions
- PascalCase: classes, interfaces, types
- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE: constants
- kebab-case: file names

## Files
- One class/interface per file
- < 300 lines
- Use index files for exports

## Code Quality
- Self-documenting names
- Comments only for complex logic
- Small, focused functions
- Max 3 nesting levels
- Handle errors explicitly

## Types
- Strict typing (no `any`)
- Interfaces for data structures
- Type guards for runtime validation
- Composition over inheritance

## Testing
- Business logic first
- Mock external dependencies
- Test name: `should [behavior] when [condition]`
