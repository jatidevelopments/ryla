# Code Style Rules

## Naming Conventions

- Use **camelCase** for variables, functions, and methods
- Use **PascalCase** for classes, interfaces, and types
- Use **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for constants
- Use **kebab-case** for file names (when applicable)
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose

## File Organization

- One class/interface per file
- Group related functionality in modules
- Keep files focused and under 300 lines when possible
- Use index files for clean exports

## Code Quality

- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Add comments for complex business logic
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3 levels)
- Handle errors explicitly, don't swallow exceptions

## Type Safety

- Use strict typing (avoid `any`)
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Use type guards for runtime validation
- Prefer composition over inheritance

## Testing

- Write tests for business logic first
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests
- Use integration tests for layer interactions
- Keep test names descriptive: `should [expected behavior] when [condition]`
