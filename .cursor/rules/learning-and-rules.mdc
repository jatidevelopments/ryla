# Learning and Rule Updates

During conversations, we often discover new patterns, best practices, or important information that should be captured in cursor rules. This rule ensures we systematically identify and document these learnings.

## When to Consider Rule Updates

After completing a task or learning something new, ask yourself:

1. Is this a recurring pattern? - Will this come up again in future work?
2. Is this project-specific knowledge? - Does this apply to RYLA specifically?
3. Is this a decision or convention? - Is this something we should consistently follow?
4. Would this help future AI agents? - Would documenting this prevent mistakes or improve efficiency?

## Process for Rule Updates

### Step 1: Identify the Learning

When you learn something that might warrant a rule update:

```
LEARNING: [Brief description of what was learned]
Context: [Why this matters]
Impact: [How this affects future work]
```

### Step 2: Determine Action

**Option A: Update Existing Rule**
- If the learning fits into an existing rule file
- Example: Learning about a new Infisical pattern → update `infisical.mdc`

**Option B: Create New Rule**
- If the learning is a new domain/concern
- Example: Learning about a new tool or pattern that doesn't fit existing rules

**Option C: No Rule Needed**
- If it's a one-time task or very specific to a single feature
- If it's already well-documented elsewhere

### Step 3: ALWAYS Confirm with User

**Before making any rule changes, you MUST:**

1. **Propose the change clearly:**
   ```
   PROPOSED RULE UPDATE:
   - File: [rule-name.mdc]
   - Action: [Update existing / Create new]
   - Reason: [Why this learning should be documented]
   - Change: [What will be added/modified]
   ```

2. **Wait for user confirmation** before:
   - Creating new rule files
   - Making significant updates to existing rules
   - Changing rule structure or organization

3. **Small clarifications** (typos, formatting) can be done without confirmation, but document learnings should always be confirmed.

## Examples

### Example 1: Learning About New Folder Structure

**Learning:** We created a `/logins` folder in Infisical for SaaS tool credentials.

**Action:** Update `infisical.mdc` to document this new folder.

**Proposal:**
```
PROPOSED RULE UPDATE:
- File: infisical.mdc
- Action: Update existing
- Reason: New /logins folder was created for SaaS credentials, should be documented
- Change: Add /logins to secrets structure diagram and add usage examples
```

### Example 2: Learning About New Pattern

**Learning:** We discovered a new pattern for handling OAuth credentials that differs from password-based logins.

**Action:** Update `infisical.mdc` to document OAuth credential patterns.

**Proposal:**
```
PROPOSED RULE UPDATE:
- File: infisical.mdc
- Action: Update existing
- Reason: OAuth credentials need different handling than passwords
- Change: Add section on OAuth credential patterns with examples
```

### Example 3: Learning About New Tool

**Learning:** We're now using a new tool (e.g., Higgsfield) that requires specific setup patterns.

**Action:** Consider creating new rule or updating relevant existing rule.

**Proposal:**
```
PROPOSED RULE UPDATE:
- File: [new-tool-name.mdc OR dependencies.mdc]
- Action: [Create new / Update existing]
- Reason: New tool requires specific patterns that should be documented
- Change: [Document tool setup, usage patterns, common pitfalls]
```

## Rule File Naming

When creating new rules:
- Use kebab-case: `learning-and-rules.mdc`
- Be descriptive: `infisical.mdc` not `secrets.mdc`
- Follow existing patterns: Check `rules-index.mdc` for naming conventions

## When NOT to Create Rules

**Don't create rules for:**
- One-time tasks or specific feature implementations
- Information already well-documented in code comments
- Very specific edge cases that won't recur
- Temporary workarounds or hacks

## Best Practices

1. **Capture learnings immediately** - Don't wait until the end of the conversation
2. **Be specific** - "We learned X" not "We learned something about Y"
3. **Link to context** - Reference the conversation or task where learning occurred
4. **Update index** - When creating new rules, update `rules-index.mdc`
5. **Keep rules focused** - One concern per rule file
