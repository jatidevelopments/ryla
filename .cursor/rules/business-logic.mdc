# Business Logic Layer

## Location
`libs/business/src/`

## Import
```typescript
import { UserService } from '@ryla/business';
```

## Services
- One service per domain entity/use case
- Contain business logic, orchestrate repositories
- Validate rules before data operations

## Domain Models
- Represent business concepts
- Focus on logic, not persistence
- Use value objects for complex types

## Business Rules
- Extract into testable functions
- Reusable across services
- Document complex rules

## Error Handling
- Domain-specific exceptions
- Never expose DB errors
- Meaningful error messages
- Log with context
