# MVP Principles

## Core Philosophy
- Build fast, validate early, iterate based on data
- Pareto focus: 80% value from 20% features
- Speed to value > perfection

## Technical Constraints

### Must Follow
- Mobile first design
- >98% browser/device compatibility
- Page load < 3 seconds
- Functionality > animations

### Avoid
- Bleeding-edge APIs (< 95% support)
- Heavy frameworks for simple features
- Complex animations that slow performance
- Features requiring browser extensions

## Decision Framework

1. Does this solve a user problem? No → Don't build
2. Is this the simplest solution? No → Simplify
3. Can we ship in < 1 week? No → Break down
4. Can we measure success? No → Define metrics first

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope (MVP)
- Core user flow
- Basic authentication
- Essential data persistence
- Analytics tracking
- Error handling

### Out of Scope (Phase 2+)
- Advanced customization
- Complex integrations
- Multi-language support
