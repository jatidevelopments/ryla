# MVP Principles

## Core
- Build fast, validate early, iterate on data
- 80% value from 20% features
- Speed > perfection

## Constraints
- Mobile first
- >98% browser compatibility
- Page load < 3s
- Functionality > animations

## Avoid
- Bleeding-edge APIs (< 95% support)
- Heavy frameworks for simple features
- Complex animations
- Browser extension requirements

## Decision Framework
1. Solves user problem? No → don't build
2. Simplest solution? No → simplify
3. Ship in < 1 week? No → break down
4. Can measure success? No → define metrics first

## Scope
**MVP**: Core flow, basic auth, data persistence, analytics, error handling
**Phase 2+**: Advanced customization, complex integrations, i18n
