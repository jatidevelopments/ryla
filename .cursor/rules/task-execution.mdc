# Task Execution SOP

Every task must follow a systematic approach. Validate incrementally, handle edge cases, break into manageable steps. Pass quality gates before completion.

## Mandatory Workflow (Every Task)

### Step 1: Task Understanding

**Before starting:**

1. **Identify task type:**
   - Initiative (IN-XXX) - Strategic business goal spanning multiple epics
   - Epic (EP-XXX) - Large feature
   - Story (ST-XXX) - Feature component
   - Task (TSK-XXX) - Specific implementation
   - Bug fix (BUG-XXX)
   - Refactoring
   - Documentation

2. **State current context:**
   ```
   Working in PHASE X – [NAME] on Epic EP-XXX, Story ST-XXX.
   Task: [Brief description]
   ```

3. **Gather required inputs:**
   - If working on Epic/Story: Check if part of Initiative (IN-XXX)
     - Read initiative document to understand "why" and success criteria
     - Ensure work aligns with initiative goals
   - Read related documentation (initiative, epic, story, architecture docs)
   - Review acceptance criteria
   - Check existing code patterns
   - Identify dependencies
   - List what you have vs. what's missing

4. **Stop if missing inputs:**
   - If inputs missing → STOP and ask user
   - Never guess or assume
   - List exactly what's needed

### Step 2: Task Breakdown

1. **Identify subtasks:**
   - List all steps required
   - Order by dependencies
   - Estimate complexity per step

2. **Identify files to change:**
   - Files to create
   - Files to modify
   - Files to review (for context)

3. **Identify dependencies:**
   - What needs to be done first?
   - What blocks this task?
   - What other tasks depend on this?

4. **Create execution plan:**
   ```
   Plan:
   1. [Step 1] - [Files affected]
   2. [Step 2] - [Files affected]
   3. [Step 3] - [Files affected]
   ```

### Step 3: Implementation

**For each sub-task:**

1. **Implement small changes:**
   - One concern at a time
   - Focused, atomic changes
   - No giant rewrites

2. **Validate incrementally:**
   - Check TypeScript types after each change
   - Verify imports resolve
   - Test logic in isolation when possible

3. **Handle edge cases:**
   - Consider null/undefined values
   - Handle error states
   - Validate inputs
   - Check boundary conditions

4. **Follow patterns:**
   - Use existing code patterns
   - Follow architecture layers
   - Apply relevant Cursor rules
   - Maintain consistency

### Step 4: Quality Checks

**Before marking complete:**

1. **Type safety:**
   - No TypeScript errors
   - All types properly defined
   - No `any` types (unless explicitly needed)

2. **Code quality:**
   - No linter errors
   - Follows code style guidelines
   - Proper error handling
   - No console.logs (use proper logging)

3. **Architecture compliance:**
   - Follows layered architecture (Apps → Business → Data)
   - No layer skipping
   - Proper imports (`@ryla/<lib>`)

4. **Testing:**
   - Critical paths have tests
   - Tests pass
   - Edge cases covered

5. **Documentation:**
   - Code is self-documenting
   - Complex logic has comments
   - Updated relevant docs if needed

### Step 5: Self-Review

**Systematic review checklist:**

1. **Functionality:**
   - [ ] Code works as expected
   - [ ] Edge cases handled
   - [ ] Error handling implemented
   - [ ] No breaking changes (or documented)

2. **Code quality:**
   - [ ] Follows style guidelines
   - [ ] No code duplication
   - [ ] Proper abstractions
   - [ ] Comments for complex logic

3. **Type safety:**
   - [ ] No TypeScript errors
   - [ ] Types properly defined
   - [ ] No implicit any

4. **Architecture:**
   - [ ] Follows layered architecture
   - [ ] No layer violations
   - [ ] Proper separation of concerns

5. **Testing:**
   - [ ] Tests added/updated
   - [ ] Tests pass
   - [ ] Coverage maintained

### Step 6: Acceptance Criteria Validation

**Check each acceptance criterion:**

```
[ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA STATUS]
1. {Criterion}: ✅/⚠️/❌ – [explanation]
2. {Criterion}: ✅/⚠️/❌ – [explanation]
3. {Criterion}: ✅/⚠️/❌ – [explanation]
```

**Status meanings:**
- ✅ Complete - Criterion fully met
- ⚠️ Partial - Criterion partially met, explain what's missing
- ❌ Not Met - Criterion not met, explain why and what's needed

**If criteria cannot be met:**
- State why clearly
- List what's missing
- Suggest alternatives if applicable
- Never mark complete if criteria not met

### Step 7: Completion

**Only mark complete when:**

1. **All quality checks pass:**
   - TypeScript: No errors
   - Linter: No errors
   - Tests: All passing
   - Architecture: Compliant

2. **All acceptance criteria met:**
   - All criteria marked ✅
   - No ⚠️ or ❌ statuses

3. **Documentation updated:**
   - Code comments added
   - Relevant docs updated
   - README updated if needed

4. **Next steps identified:**
   - Clear next action or phase
   - Dependencies documented
   - Blockers identified (if any)

## Task Types and Specific Workflows

### Creating an Initiative

**When to create:**
- Strategic business goal requiring multiple epics
- Need to coordinate work across teams/areas
- Success requires measurable business outcomes
- Goal spans multiple quarters or phases

**Workflow:**
1. Check if initiative already exists - Review `docs/initiatives/README.md`
2. Use template - Copy `docs/initiatives/INITIATIVE-TEMPLATE.md`, name: `IN-XXX-[short-description].md`
3. Fill required sections - Why, How, When, Who, Success Criteria, Definition of Done
4. Update index - Add to `docs/initiatives/README.md` index table
5. Link to related work - Link related epics, reference ADRs if needed

See `.cursor/rules/initiatives.mdc` for detailed guidance

### New Feature (Epic/Story)

1. **Check initiative context:**
   - If epic is part of initiative: Read initiative document first
   - Understand the "why" and success criteria
   - Ensure epic contributes to initiative goals
   - Follow initiative principles and constraints
   - Link epic to initiative in "Related Work" section

2. **Follow 10-Phase Pipeline:**
   - Start at appropriate phase
   - Complete phase outputs before moving to next
   - Never skip phases

3. **Architecture first:**
   - Design data model
   - Define API contracts
   - Plan component structure

4. **Implementation:**
   - Start with data layer → business logic → presentation layer
   - Follow Apps → Business → Data flow
   - If adding secrets/config: Use Infisical (see `infisical.mdc`) - never create `.env` files

5. **Testing:**
   - Write tests as you go (TDD when applicable)
   - Test critical paths
   - Verify analytics events

6. **Initiative alignment check:**
   - Does this work contribute to initiative success criteria?
   - Does this work follow initiative principles?
   - Does this work respect initiative constraints?
   - Update initiative progress if applicable

### Bug Fix

1. **Reproduce bug:**
   - Understand the issue
   - Identify root cause
   - Create test case that reproduces bug

2. **Fix:**
   - Implement minimal fix
   - Don't refactor unnecessarily
   - Fix root cause, not symptoms

3. **Verify:**
   - Test case now passes
   - No regressions introduced
   - Edge cases handled

### Refactoring

1. **Identify scope:**
   - What needs refactoring?
   - Why? (maintainability, performance, etc.)
   - What's the target state?

2. **Plan refactoring:**
   - Break into small steps
   - Ensure tests exist first
   - Refactor incrementally

3. **Verify:**
   - All tests still pass
   - Functionality unchanged
   - Code quality improved

### Documentation

1. **Identify audience:**
   - Who will read this?
   - What do they need to know?
   - What's the purpose?

2. **Structure:**
   - Clear headings
   - Examples where helpful
   - Links to related docs

3. **Review:**
   - Accurate and up-to-date
   - Clear and concise
   - Well-organized

## Handling Blockers

**When you encounter a blocker:**

1. **Identify blocker:**
   - What's blocking progress?
   - Why is it blocking?
   - What's needed to unblock?

2. **Document blocker:**
   ```
   BLOCKER: [Description]
   Reason: [Why it's blocking]
   Required: [What's needed]
   Workaround: [If any]
   ```

3. **Escalate if needed:**
   - If blocker requires user input → ask user
   - If blocker requires external dependency → document and continue other work
   - If blocker is architectural → discuss with team

4. **Continue other work:**
   - Work on unblocked parts
   - Don't wait idly
   - Make progress where possible

## Error Recovery

**When something breaks:**

1. **Identify the issue:**
   - What broke?
   - When did it break?
   - What changed recently?

2. **Revert if needed:**
   - If recent change caused issue → revert
   - If unsure → ask user
   - Don't make things worse

3. **Fix systematically:**
   - Understand root cause
   - Fix properly, not with hacks
   - Verify fix works

4. **Learn and document:**
   - Document what went wrong
   - Document how it was fixed
   - Update process if needed
