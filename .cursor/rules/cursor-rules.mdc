# Cursor Rules Writing Guide

When writing or modifying Cursor rules, follow these guidelines:

## Way of Work Alignment

When writing or modifying rules, follow way-of-work principles:

- Bullet points > paragraphs - Use bullets, not paragraphs
- Examples > explanations - Lead with examples, minimize explanations
- Say only what moves work forward - Remove filler, repetition, emotional padding
- One line if possible - Be concise, enough clarity to avoid follow-ups

Context sections: Convert verbose "## Context" bullet lists to one-line summaries. Example:
- Before: `## Context\n\n- Point 1\n- Point 2\n- Point 3`
- After: `Point 1. Point 2. Point 3.`

Section headers: Remove bold formatting from headers unless necessary for emphasis.

Best practices: Convert numbered lists with bold items to simple bullet lists.

## File Access

- When you know the rule filename, use `read_file` instead of searching to read rules
- All rules are in `.cursor/rules/` directory at project root

## Code Examples

- Examples should be minimal, showing only the core concept
- Remove unnecessary imports/exports, but keep essential imports
- If multiple examples in one file, omit repeated imports after the first
- No need to write `export` statements
- Omit try/catch, CSS, or other code unrelated to the demonstration
- Remove unhelpful comments, keep comments that aid understanding

## Format

- Check original document language before modifying, maintain consistency
- Use `-` for unordered lists consistently
- Periods at end of list items are unnecessary
- Avoid excessive formatting (bold, inline code) - rules are primarily for LLM consumption
- Avoid word-by-word translations. If parentheses contain examples rather than translations, keep them
- Convert "## Context" sections to one-line summaries when possible
- Remove bold from section headers unless necessary for emphasis

## Review Checklist

- Fix Markdown syntax issues
- Correct typos
- Point out inconsistencies between examples and explanations
- Ensure frontmatter is correct (description, globs, alwaysApply)
- Verify code examples are accurate and runnable
- Check way-of-work alignment (bullets > paragraphs, examples > explanations, concise)
- Verify context sections are condensed to one-line summaries

## Frontmatter Guidelines

```yaml
---
description: Brief description of what this rule covers
globs: ["*.ts", "*.tsx"]  # Optional: file patterns this applies to
alwaysApply: true|false   # Whether rule is always active
---
```

## Best Practices

- One rule per concern/domain
- Use descriptive filenames (kebab-case)
- Keep rules focused and scoped
- Link to related rules when helpful
- Include examples that match RYLA's patterns
- Update `rules-index.mdc` when adding new rules
