# Presentation Layer Rules

## Controllers

- Controllers handle HTTP-specific concerns only
- Extract request data to DTOs immediately
- Call business services, don't implement logic
- Return standardized response formats
- Handle HTTP status codes appropriately

## DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

- Use DTOs for all API inputs and outputs
- Validate DTOs before passing to business layer
- DTOs should not contain business logic
- Document required vs optional fields

## Routes

- Organize routes by resource/domain
- Use RESTful conventions when applicable
- Version APIs appropriately
- Document route parameters and query strings

## Middleware

- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Authentication/authorization middleware
- Request logging middleware
- Error handling middleware
- Rate limiting middleware

## Response Format

- Use consistent response structure
- Include error details in error responses
- Don't expose internal errors to clients
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
