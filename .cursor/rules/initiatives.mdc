# Business Initiatives Guidelines

## Context

Business initiatives are strategic goals that drive product development and span multiple epics. They provide the "why" behind features and help coordinate work across teams.

## Initiative System

### Location
- **Directory**: `docs/initiatives/`
- **Template**: `docs/initiatives/INITIATIVE-TEMPLATE.md`
- **Naming**: `IN-XXX-[short-description].md` (e.g., `IN-001-cloudflare-migration.md`)

### When to Create an Initiative

**Create an initiative when:**
- ✅ Strategic business goal requires multiple epics
- ✅ Need to coordinate work across teams/areas
- ✅ Success requires measurable business outcomes
- ✅ Goal spans multiple quarters or phases
- ✅ Need to track progress against business metrics

**Don't create an initiative for:**
- ❌ Single epic or feature (use epic instead)
- ❌ Technical refactoring (use ADR instead)
- ❌ Bug fixes or small improvements

### Initiative vs Epic

| Aspect | Initiative | Epic |
|--------|-----------|------|
| **Scope** | Strategic business goal | Feature area |
| **Duration** | Months/quarters | Weeks/months |
| **Output** | Business outcomes | Product features |
| **Contains** | Multiple epics | Multiple stories |
| **Success** | Business metrics | Feature completion |

## Creating an Initiative

### Step 1: Use the Template

Always start with the template:
```bash
cp docs/initiatives/INITIATIVE-TEMPLATE.md docs/initiatives/IN-XXX-[name].md
```

### Step 2: Fill Required Sections

**Mandatory sections:**
1. **Why (Business Rationale)** - Problem statement, current state, desired state
2. **How (Approach & Strategy)** - Strategy, principles, phases
3. **When (Timeline & Priority)** - Timeline, milestones, priority
4. **Who (Stakeholders & Ownership)** - Owner, stakeholders, teams
5. **Success Criteria** - Primary metrics, business impact, indicators
6. **Definition of Done** - Completion criteria, not done criteria

**Optional but recommended:**
- Risks & Mitigation
- Progress Tracking
- Lessons Learned

### Step 3: Link to Related Work

- Link to related epics in "Related Work" section
- Reference ADRs if architectural decisions are needed
- Link to research or technical docs if applicable

### Step 4: Update Index

Update `docs/initiatives/README.md` with the new initiative:
```markdown
| [IN-XXX](./IN-XXX-name.md) | [Name] | [Status] | [Metric] | [Owner] |
```

## Working with Initiatives

### When Starting Work on an Initiative

1. **Read the initiative document** - Understand the "why"
2. **Check success criteria** - Know what success looks like
3. **Review related epics** - Understand what needs to be built
4. **Check dependencies** - Ensure prerequisites are met
5. **Update progress** - Add current phase and status

### When Creating Epics from an Initiative

1. **Reference the initiative** - Link epic to initiative
2. **Align with success criteria** - Ensure epic contributes to initiative goals
3. **Follow initiative principles** - Adhere to strategy and constraints
4. **Update initiative** - Add epic to "Related Work" section

### When Updating Initiative Status

**Status values:**
- **Proposed** - Initiative identified, template filled out
- **Active** - Initiative is driving current work
- **On Hold** - Temporarily paused, may resume
- **Completed** - Success criteria met, initiative closed
- **Cancelled** - Initiative abandoned, reason documented

**Update when:**
- Status changes (e.g., Proposed → Active)
- Milestones reached
- Risks identified or mitigated
- Success criteria met
- Initiative completed or cancelled

### Progress Tracking

**Update "Progress Tracking" section:**
- Current phase and status
- Recent updates (date + description)
- Next steps

**Status values:**
- **On Track** - Progressing as planned
- **At Risk** - May not meet timeline/success criteria
- **Blocked** - Cannot proceed due to dependency/issue

## Success Criteria

### Business Metrics

Every initiative must target at least one business metric (A-E):
- **A - Activation**: Signup → first core action
- **B - Retention**: E7/E30 engagement signal
- **C - Core Value**: North Star usage metric
- **D - Conversion**: Trial → paid
- **E - CAC**: Acquisition cost optimization

### Measurable Outcomes

Success criteria must be:
- ✅ **Specific** - Clear, unambiguous targets
- ✅ **Measurable** - Quantifiable metrics
- ✅ **Achievable** - Realistic given constraints
- ✅ **Relevant** - Aligned with business goals
- ✅ **Time-bound** - Timeline for measurement

**Example:**
```markdown
| Metric | Target | Measurement Method | Timeline |
|--------|--------|-------------------|----------|
| Activation Rate | +15% | PostHog funnel: signup → first_generation | 3 months |
| Cost per User | -20% | Infrastructure spend / active users | 6 months |
```

## Definition of Done

### Initiative Complete When:
- [ ] All success criteria met
- [ ] All related epics completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Stakeholders notified
- [ ] Post-mortem/retrospective completed
- [ ] Metrics validated
- [ ] Lessons learned documented

### Not Done Criteria

**This initiative is NOT done if:**
- [ ] Success criteria not met
- [ ] Related epics incomplete
- [ ] Documentation missing
- [ ] Metrics not validated
- [ ] Stakeholders not aligned
- [ ] Technical debt introduced without plan

## Integration with Development Process

### Initiative → Epic → Story → Task Flow

1. **Initiative** defines the strategic goal
2. **Epic** implements part of the initiative
3. **Story** implements part of the epic
4. **Task** implements part of the story

### When Creating Epics

**Reference the initiative:**
```markdown
## Related Initiative

This epic is part of [IN-XXX: Initiative Name](./docs/initiatives/IN-XXX-name.md).

**Initiative Goal**: [Brief description]
**This Epic's Contribution**: [How this epic contributes to the initiative]
```

### When Working on Stories

**Check initiative alignment:**
- Does this story contribute to initiative success criteria?
- Does this story follow initiative principles?
- Does this story respect initiative constraints?

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Initiatives Focused

- One clear business goal per initiative
- Avoid scope creep - if it doesn't contribute to success criteria, it's out of scope
- Split large initiatives into phases if needed

### 2. Regular Updates

- Update progress at least monthly
- Document blockers and risks immediately
- Celebrate milestones and wins

### 3. Clear Ownership

- One clear owner per initiative
- Owner responsible for updates and communication
- Stakeholders clearly identified

### 4. Data-Driven

- Success criteria must be measurable
- Track leading and lagging indicators
- Validate assumptions with data

### 5. Learn and Adapt

- Document lessons learned
- Update strategy based on learnings
- Share insights with team

## Examples

### Good Initiative
- **Clear problem**: "High infrastructure costs limiting growth"
- **Measurable success**: "Reduce costs by 30% while maintaining performance"
- **Specific timeline**: "Complete migration by Q2 2026"
- **Clear ownership**: "Infrastructure team, led by [Name]"

### Bad Initiative
- **Vague goal**: "Improve the product"
- **Unmeasurable success**: "Make it better"
- **No timeline**: "When it's done"
- **No owner**: "Everyone"

- **Initiative Template**: `docs/initiatives/INITIATIVE-TEMPLATE.md`
- **Initiative Index**: `docs/initiatives/README.md`
- **Business Metrics**: `docs/process/BUSINESS-METRICS.md`
- **Epic Structure**: `docs/requirements/epics/`
- **ADR Template**: `docs/decisions/ADR-TEMPLATE.md`

## Quick Reference

**Create initiative:**
```bash
cp docs/initiatives/INITIATIVE-TEMPLATE.md docs/initiatives/IN-XXX-name.md
# Fill template, update README.md index
```

**Update initiative:**
- Change status when appropriate
- Update progress tracking section
- Add recent updates with dates
- Document risks and mitigations

**Link epic to initiative:**
```markdown
## Related Initiative

This epic is part of [IN-XXX: Initiative Name](../../initiatives/IN-XXX-name.md).
```

**Check initiative alignment:**
- Does this work contribute to initiative success criteria?
- Does this work follow initiative principles?
- Does this work respect initiative constraints?
