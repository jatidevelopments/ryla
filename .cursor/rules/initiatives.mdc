# Business Initiatives Guidelines

Strategic goals spanning multiple epics. Provide the "why" behind features and coordinate work across teams.

## Location
- Directory: `docs/initiatives/`
- Template: `docs/initiatives/INITIATIVE-TEMPLATE.md`
- Naming: `IN-XXX-[short-description].md` (e.g., `IN-001-cloudflare-migration.md`)

## When to Create

**Create when:**
- Strategic business goal requires multiple epics
- Need to coordinate work across teams/areas
- Success requires measurable business outcomes
- Goal spans multiple quarters or phases
- Need to track progress against business metrics

**Don't create for:**
- Single epic or feature (use epic instead)
- Technical refactoring (use ADR instead)
- Bug fixes or small improvements

## Initiative vs Epic

| Aspect | Initiative | Epic |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Scope | Strategic business goal | Feature area |
| Duration | Months/quarters | Weeks/months |
| Output | Business outcomes | Product features |
| Contains | Multiple epics | Multiple stories |
| Success | Business metrics | Feature completion |

## Creating an Initiative

1. **Use template:**
```bash
cp docs/initiatives/INITIATIVE-TEMPLATE.md docs/initiatives/IN-XXX-[name].md
```

2. **Fill required sections:**
- Why (Business Rationale) - Problem, current state, desired state
- How (Approach & Strategy) - Strategy, principles, phases
- When (Timeline & Priority) - Timeline, milestones, priority
- Who (Stakeholders & Ownership) - Owner, stakeholders, teams
- Success Criteria - Primary metrics, business impact, indicators
- Definition of Done - Completion criteria, not done criteria

**Optional:** Risks & Mitigation, Progress Tracking, Lessons Learned

3. **Link to related work:**
- Link related epics in "Related Work" section
- Reference ADRs if architectural decisions needed
- Link research or technical docs if applicable

4. **Update index:**
```markdown
| [IN-XXX](./IN-XXX-name.md) | [Name] | [Status] | [Metric] | [Owner] |
```

## Working with Initiatives

**When starting work:**
1. Read initiative document - understand the "why"
2. Check success criteria - know what success looks like
3. Review related epics - understand what needs to be built
4. Check dependencies - ensure prerequisites are met
5. Update progress - add current phase and status

**When creating epics:**
1. Reference the initiative - link epic to initiative
2. Align with success criteria - ensure epic contributes to initiative goals
3. Follow initiative principles - adhere to strategy and constraints
4. Update initiative - add epic to "Related Work" section
5. Set epic status - add status field to epic file (see Epic Status Tracking below)

## Epic Status Tracking

**Every epic MUST have status field at top:**

```markdown
# [EPIC] EP-XXX: Epic Name

**Status**: Proposed  
**Phase**: P1 - Requirements  
**Initiative**: [IN-XXX] (if applicable)  
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Owner**: [Team/Person]
```

**Status values:**
- Proposed - Requirements/scoping complete (P1-P2), not started
- In Progress - Architecture/implementation (P3-P6), actively working
- In Review - Testing/deployment (P7-P9), implementation complete
- Completed - Production validated (P10 complete), fully done
- On Hold - Temporarily paused, may resume
- Cancelled - Abandoned, no longer needed

**Update when:**
- Phase changes (P2 → P3 = Proposed → In Progress)
- Implementation complete (In Progress → In Review)
- Production validated (In Review → Completed)
- Work paused/resumed (In Progress ↔ On Hold)
- Epic abandoned (any status → Cancelled)

**Also update:**
- README status column in epic directory
- Initiative "Related Work" section if epic status changes
- "Last Updated" date

See `docs/process/EPIC-STATUS-TRACKING.md` for full guidelines.

## Initiative Status

**Status values:**
- Proposed - Initiative identified, template filled out
- Active - Initiative is driving current work
- On Hold - Temporarily paused, may resume
- Completed - Success criteria met, initiative closed
- Cancelled - Initiative abandoned, reason documented

**Update when:**
- Status changes (Proposed → Active)
- Milestones reached
- Risks identified or mitigated
- Success criteria met
- Initiative completed or cancelled

## Progress Tracking

**Update "Progress Tracking" section:**
- Current phase and status
- Recent updates (date + description)
- Next steps

**Status values:**
- On Track - Progressing as planned
- At Risk - May not meet timeline/success criteria
- Blocked - Cannot proceed due to dependency/issue

## Success Criteria

**Every initiative must target at least one business metric (A-E):**
- A - Activation: Signup → first core action
- B - Retention: E7/E30 engagement signal
- C - Core Value: North Star usage metric
- D - Conversion: Trial → paid
- E - CAC: Acquisition cost optimization

**Success criteria must be:**
- Specific - Clear, unambiguous targets
- Measurable - Quantifiable metrics
- Achievable - Realistic given constraints
- Relevant - Aligned with business goals
- Time-bound - Timeline for measurement

**Example:**
```markdown
| Metric | Target | Measurement Method | Timeline |
|--------|--------|-------------------|----------|
| Activation Rate | +15% | PostHog funnel: signup → first_generation | 3 months |
| Cost per User | -20% | Infrastructure spend / active users | 6 months |
```

## Definition of Done

**Initiative complete when:**
- [ ] All success criteria met
- [ ] All related epics completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Stakeholders notified
- [ ] Post-mortem/retrospective completed
- [ ] Metrics validated
- [ ] Lessons learned documented

**NOT done if:**
- [ ] Success criteria not met
- [ ] Related epics incomplete
- [ ] Documentation missing
- [ ] Metrics not validated
- [ ] Stakeholders not aligned
- [ ] Technical debt introduced without plan

## Integration with Development Process

**Initiative → Epic → Story → Task Flow:**
1. Initiative defines the strategic goal
2. Epic implements part of the initiative
3. Story implements part of the epic
4. Task implements part of the story

**When creating epics, reference the initiative:**
```markdown
## Related Initiative

This epic is part of [IN-XXX: Initiative Name](./docs/initiatives/IN-XXX-name.md).

**Initiative Goal**: [Brief description]
**This Epic's Contribution**: [How this epic contributes to the initiative]
```

**When working on stories, check initiative alignment:**
- Does this story contribute to initiative success criteria?
- Does this story follow initiative principles?
- Does this story respect initiative constraints?

## Best Practices

- **Keep focused** - One clear business goal per initiative. Avoid scope creep. Split large initiatives into phases if needed
- **Regular updates** - Update progress at least monthly. Document blockers and risks immediately. Celebrate milestones
- **Clear ownership** - One clear owner per initiative. Owner responsible for updates and communication. Stakeholders clearly identified
- **Data-driven** - Success criteria must be measurable. Track leading and lagging indicators. Validate assumptions with data
- **Learn and adapt** - Document lessons learned. Update strategy based on learnings. Share insights with team

## Examples

**Good Initiative:**
- Clear problem: "High infrastructure costs limiting growth"
- Measurable success: "Reduce costs by 30% while maintaining performance"
- Specific timeline: "Complete migration by Q2 2026"
- Clear ownership: "Infrastructure team, led by [Name]"

**Bad Initiative:**
- Vague goal: "Improve the product"
- Unmeasurable success: "Make it better"
- No timeline: "When it's done"
- No owner: "Everyone"

## Quick Reference

**Create initiative:**
```bash
cp docs/initiatives/INITIATIVE-TEMPLATE.md docs/initiatives/IN-XXX-name.md
# Fill template, update README.md index
```

**Link epic to initiative:**
```markdown
## Related Initiative

This epic is part of [IN-XXX: Initiative Name](../../initiatives/IN-XXX-name.md).
```

**Check initiative alignment:**
- Does this work contribute to initiative success criteria?
- Does this work follow initiative principles?
- Does this work respect initiative constraints?
